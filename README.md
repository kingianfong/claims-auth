# claims-auth

This was written for a case competition to price a product for weather-related risk in Singapore. Our product protects against surge pricing due to rain for ride-hailing services and comes in the form of coupons redeemable only in the event of rain.

This script demonstrates how the claims for this product could be authenticated automatically and in real time using live weather API from National Environmental Agency and KNN from scikit-learn.

This was written in March 2019. As of August 2019, the API no longer worked in its current state.
